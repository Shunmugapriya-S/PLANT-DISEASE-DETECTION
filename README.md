## PLANT DISEASE DIAGNOSIS APP
A platform to connect the farmer and the plant through AI

Your plants can now speak to you!
Whenever a plant falls sick, it often goes unnoticed until it’s too late. This app acts as a bridge between the plant and the farmer, giving your crops a voice.

##v How It Works

1.  The farmer uploads a leaf image through the app.


2.  AI-powered CNN model analyzes the leaf and detects whether the plant is healthy or diseased.


3.  Once diagnosed, the system alerts the farmer instantly about the plant’s health status.


4. The alert is delivered in the farmer’s native language, making it easy to understand.


5. Along with the alert, the app also shares remedies, crop-care tips, and prevention measures.

## Why This Matters

Empowers farmers to take action at the right time.

Bridges communication between crops and their caretakers.

Supports multiple languages so every farmer can access plant health updates.

Prevents crop loss by catching diseases early.
